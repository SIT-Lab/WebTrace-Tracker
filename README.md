  ### D. End Task Options
  This is the page where you decide how to end the task.

  - **Pause:** Participants can pause the test by clicking the ‚ÄúPause‚Äù button during the session. When this feature is activated, the recording of participant activities is temporarily halted until the ‚ÄúResume‚Äù button is clicked.

  - **Finish:** Participants can complete the test by clicking the ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù button
when they successfully accomplish the given task. In this case, all
collected data up to that point is sent to Firebase, and the test session
ends.

  - **Give up:** Participants can end the test by clicking the "Give up" button if they believe completing the task is impossible.

  - **Quit:** Participants can quit the test at any time by clicking the ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù button, unrelated to the task itself. In this case, the collected data is considered unsuitable for analysis and is therefore discarded
instead of being sent to Firebase.
